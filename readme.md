# Sampling with the help of a generative model: A tutorial


You can run the tutorial locally by cloning the repo from the folder you want to work in:
```
git clone https://github.com/marylou-gabrie/tutorial-sampling-enhanced-w-generative-models.git
```
or downloading the files directly from the Github interface.

To use the tutorial on Colab you will also need to download the files (use one of the solutions above). Then, add them to your Google Drive and open the notebook `tutorial_sampling_enhanced_w_generative_models.ipynb` from there.
